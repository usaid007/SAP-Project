# Smart Door Access with RFID

# PROBLEM  STATEMENT:
The problem is to design a secure and convenient smart door access system using RFID technology to control access to a building or facility, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter and denying entry to unauthorized individuals. The system should be efficient, reliable, and easy to use, providing a high-level of security against information breaches and unauthorized entry.
